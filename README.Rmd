# Overview

**kpthor** is a PWA that lets you track your dog's activity over time.

# Preqreqs

## R
This app requires `R (>= 4.0)`, available for download at https://cloud.r-project.org/. 

### packages
To run the app, a few R package dependencies are needed. These are documented in the `DESCRIPTION` file, but the code below will install all packages (and their dependencies) imported by the app. 

``` r
deps_to_scan <- c("Imports", "Suggests")
uapply <- function(...) unlist(lapply(...))
libs_sub <- function(x) sub(
  " .*", 
  "", 
  trimws(
    stringi::stri_split(
      yaml::read_yaml("DESCRIPTION")[[x]], 
      fixed = ","
    )[[1]]
  )
)
install.packages(uapply(deps_to_scan, libs_sub), dependencies = TRUE)
```

## IPC / streaming
The app uses the R package `liteq` for inter-process communication, and thus requires a specific file to use as a thread-safe database. We will also need to set the queue to be writable by the user who will run the app. For this example, the `shiny` user will run the app. This user is also a member of the `shiny` group, who will receive write access to the directory and file. To set this up, we will need to run the following chunk in a terminal, then the second chunk in R:

``` sh
mkdir db/
chgrp -R shiny db/
chmod -R g+ws db/
```

``` r
install.packages("liteq")
liteq::ensure_queue("timerq", db = "db/timerq")
```

## DBMS
The app uses a database to store pets, actions, and events. The db interface functions are defined in `R/class_dbInterface.R`, and connection parameters are configured by the `golem_opts$dbi` field (see `R/run_app.R`). The DSN name is taken from the `inst/golem-config.yml` file, depending on which mode is set in `.Renviron`. 

Once the driver and DSN are configured on your machine, the database will need to then be loaded with tables that are required by the app. Functions to create these tables can be found in `R/class_dbInterface.R`.

### DSN configuration
The DSN name used for production is `KPthorSQL`, but supports a `development` mode which uses the `KPthorSQL-dev` DSN name. Add the contents of `config/etc/odbc.ini` to your host server's `/etc/odbc.ini` file (`~/.odbc.ini` on macOS), and fill in your specific connection details.

### Driver configuration
The ODBC driver needs to downloaded from the internet. Add the contents of `config/etc/odbcinst.ini` to your server's `/etc/odbcinst.ini` file.

# Installation

You can install the released version of **kpthor** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mhdzy/kpthor")
```

You can also clone the **kpthor** source code by running:

``` zsh
git clone git@github.com:mhdzy/kpthor.git
```

# Run App

This is how you run the app from the package (prod):

```r
# library(kpthor)
kpthor::run_app()
```

This is how you run the app from the repository (dev):

```r
# setwd("kpthor/")
runApp("app.R")
```

# Host App

The app was primarily developed on macOS 11.16 running R 4.1.0 with an i7 processor and 32GB RAM. 

I hosted this app on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4 GB) running Raspbian (arm64) ([download here](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/raspios_arm64-2021-05-28/)). This required building Shiny Server from source, and I loosely followed [this guide](https://community.rstudio.com/t/setting-up-your-own-shiny-server-rstudio-server-on-a-raspberry-pi-3b/18982) from `andresrcs`. There is also an update guide using Ansible, available [here](https://andresrcs.rbind.io/2021/01/13/raspberry_pi_server/).

## Local

Install R, package dependencies (see `DESCRIPTION`), setup PostgreSQL, configure the OS files found in `config/`, then run the app.

TODO

- [ ] Failover to RSQLite temporary in-memory db when Postgres is unavailable.

## Shiny Server
Deploying the `kpthor` app to Shiny Server requires a live Shiny Server installation, available for download here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/. 

The config file is found in `config/etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf`. 

### X11 / Xvfb
Viewing plots and graphics requires a window service, and the file `config/etc/init/shiny-server.conf` contains the startup script to enable Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer).
